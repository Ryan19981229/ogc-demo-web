# Project Description and Goals

D120 - Demonstrator generative AI-enabled virtual assistant that answers user queries based on its LLM and is capable of providing plain language answers to questions about risks, hazards, and impacts of coastal flooding in Canada.

- Development of the GenAI knowledge base: Equip the GenAI virtual assistant with a knowledge base incorporating materials approved by the Sponsors (example material). This assistant should be able to communicate information relevant to multiple audiences, including non-experts and experts in different domains (e.g., adjustors).

- Evaluate and document the usability of different sources of spatial information (e.g., text, risk and hazard maps, other visualizations, tabular data) to fine-tune or train the LLM. Example information formats could include: map, text, etc.

- Evaluate and document methods for extracting geospatial knowledge relevant to the hazards, risks, and impacts of coastal flooding from the LLM.
