- Split: RAG starts by converting structured or unstructured documents into plain text and then breaking the text into smaller segments, or chunks, for easier processing.

- Embed Documents: A text embedding model processes each chunk, transforming it into a vector that captures its semantic meaning.

- VectorDB: These vectors are stored in a vector database, which serves as the foundation for efficient data retrieval.

- Retrieval: When a user submits a query, the vector database quickly identifies and retrieves the chunks most relevant to the query.

- Response Generation: Finally, a large language model (LLM) synthesizes the retrieved chunks to produce a coherent and informative response.
