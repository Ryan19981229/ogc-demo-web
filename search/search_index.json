Embedding models are a foundational technology in Natural Language Processing (NLP), enabling text data to be converted into numerical formats for efficient processing, computation, and analysis by machines.</p> <p>The core idea of Embedding models is to convert words or sentences into fixed-length vectors (typically high-dimensional numerical vectors). This allows computational systems to interpret language data and capture semantic similarities. For instance, word Embedding models like Word2Vec and GloVe map words into a high-dimensional space where their semantic relationships are reflected in the relative distances between their corresponding vectors.</p>"},{"location":"Section3-Glossary%20of%20Terms/#vector-database","title":"Vector Database","text":"<p>A Vector Database is a specialized database system designed to store and manage high-dimensional vector data.

These models may provide outdated or inaccurate responses when dealing with new information or rapidly evolving fields. Updating the model through retraining or fine-tuning to expand its knowledge requires substantial time and computational resources.</p> <p>RAG combines retrieval and generation techniques to address these challenges. It enhances the language model's knowledge by retrieving relevant information from an external database and incorporating it into responses. This approach ensures timeliness and accuracy in the assistant\u2019s outputs. Additionally, RAG reduces reliance on large-scale parameters, as the retrieval system supplies the necessary information, and the generation model focuses solely on crafting responses based on those inputs.</p> <p>This dual approach improves system efficiency and simplifies model training. RAG balances knowledge coverage and response quality, making it particularly effective in scenarios requiring dynamic data updates. By integrating RAG, our Virtual Assistant achieves enhanced accuracy, flexibility, and efficiency in generating reliable, up-to-date responses.</p>"},{"location":"Section3-Technology%20Description/#technology-used","title":"Technology Used","text":"<ul> <li>Development Framework: Langchain 0.3</li> <li>Programming Language: python 3.12.8</li> <li>Generative Language Model: OPENAI GPT-4\uff08Generative Pre-trained Transformer\uff09</li> <li>Embedding Model: OpenAI Embeddings</li> <li>Vector Database: Chroma</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Section4-FAQ/","title":"FAQ","text":""},{"location":"Section4-FAQ/#questions-to-ask","title":"Questions to ask:","text":"<p>Q1\uff1aWhat percentage of buildings do you estimate are at risk of coastal/lake flooding (e.g., 1 in 100- year floodplain, taking into account climate change projections)?</p> <p>Q2\uff1aWhat percentage of buildings do you estimate are at high-risk of coastal/lake flooding (e.g., in the current 1 in 20-year floodplain)?</p> <p>Q3\uff1aHow does climate change increase the risk of flooding in Canada?</p> <p>Q4\uff1aWhat is the difference between coastal flooding and river flooding?</p> <p>Q5\uff1aWhat steps can I take to prepare for a coastal flood?</p> <p>Q6\uff1aHow does coastal flooding affect the environment?</p> <p>Q7\uff1aWhat measures can communities take to reduce flood risks?</p> <p>Q8\uff1aWhat are the estimated economic losses from floods in Canada each year?</p> <p>Q9\uff1aHow far away should you operate a portable generator from your home during a flood?</p> <p>Q10\uff1aHow wide should a sandbag wall be compared to its height to effectively prevent flooding?</p> <p>Q11\uff1aWhat is one key step to reduce the risk of flooding in your home?</p> <p>Q12\uff1aWhat is the peak flood time during a flash flood?</p> <p>Q13\uff1aWhat percentage of flood damage costs in the Saint John River basin is caused by ice-related events?</p> <p>Q14\uff1aHow fast can the surging flow caused by the sudden release of a major ice jam travel?</p> <p>Q15\uff1aWhat is the average cost of repairing a flooded basement in Canada?</p> <p>Q16\uff1aHow much does it cost to prevent a basement flood, and how long does it take?</p> <p>Q17\uff1aWhat percentage of Canadian homes are at risk of flooding?</p> <p>Q18\uff1aWhat percentage of homes with property insurance in Canada have flood insurance coverage?</p> <p>Q19\uff1aBy how much could financial losses increase during an extreme flood event caused by global warming of around 4\u02daC by 2100?</p>"},{"location":"Section4-Scenario%20Demonstration/","title":"Scenario Demonstration","text":""},{"location":"Section4-User%20Manual/","title":"User Manual","text":"<p>Step 1: Access the Demo Project</p> <p>Step 2: Start Asking Questions</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Section5-Demo%20Project/","title":"Demo Project","text":""},{"location":"Section5-Demo%20Project/#ai-enabled-virtual-assistant","title":"AI-Enabled Virtual Assistant","text":""}]}
